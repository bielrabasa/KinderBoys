### Description of the game

Super Smash TV is a game set in a dystopic future where the main way of entertain the public is with a TV Show called Super Smash Tv, where the contestant (player) has to survive multiple stages where tons of enemies will try to kill him. The player has to collect items, money and extra lives by killing the enemies and finally, after having completed a certain number of rooms, will have to defeat a boss to win the TV show and become rich.
